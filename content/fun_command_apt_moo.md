Today I stumbled upon a nice easter egg in the `apt-get` family: `moo` *command*.

````
$ apt-get moo
                 (__) 
                 (oo) 
           /------\/ 
          / |    ||   
         *  /\---/\ 
            ~~   ~~   
..."Have you mooed today?"...
````

But the fun does not finished here. You can add `-v` switch for verbosity and then `-vv` for *more* verbosity and then just add `v`s and enjoy.
